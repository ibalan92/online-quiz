## Online-quiz

## Description 

 This project consists in a web application with a javascript knowledge quiz.
 It gives the user the opportunity to go through ten questions in 200 seconds. For every wrong answer 10 seconds are deducted from the time and a buzzer will sound. For a correct answer a different buzzer will sound. At the end of the quiz the user is able to store his score and visualise it onto the Highscores page, where the user can clear all the stored scores or go back and take the quiz again
 
 The website should look similar to the screenshots below:
